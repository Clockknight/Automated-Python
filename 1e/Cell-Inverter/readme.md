spreadsheet management readme

##Cell Inverter:
This script uses the openpyxl library to "invert" a spreadsheet, making rows into columns and vice versa.

###Motivation in making this script:
This script was one of the practice projects in [Automate the Boring stuff with Python]. Writing this code helped develop my understanding of python, and the lesson from the chapter this project was in, specifically how to manipulate information, and how it's organized within that spreadsheet.

###Installation Instructions:

###How to use:
This program is very simple to use. Just follow the prompts inside of the command line prompt, and the script will invert a spreadsheet once a path to one has been established.

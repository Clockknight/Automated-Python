Q:

1. What is []?

A:

An empty list. Something with no listed items.

Q:

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)

For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

A:

spam[2] = 'hello'

Q:

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?

A:

'd'

Q:

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?

A:

'd'

Q:

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

A:

['a', 'b']

Q:

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?

A:

1

Q:

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?

A:

[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

Q:

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

A:

[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

Q:

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?

A:

List concatenation uses the + operator, and replication uses the * operator.

Q:

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?

A:

Append puts the values at the end, where insert puts them at a specified index.

Q:

11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?

A:

By using the del statement, and the remove() list method.

Q:

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.

A:

Lists are similar to strings in that

Q:

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?

A:

Tuples cannot be changed, and use () instead of []

Q:

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?

A:

(42)

Q:

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?

A:

Tuples can be turned into lists by using the list() function, and lists can be turned into tuples with the tuple() function.

Q:

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?

A:

Memory indexes to where the lists' values are stored.

Q:

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

A:

Deepcopy will copy "deeper", taking the value of memory indexes referenced instead of just wherever they are.

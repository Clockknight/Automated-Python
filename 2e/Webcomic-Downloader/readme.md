##Webcomic Downloader:
This script uses webscraping libraries like BeautifulSoup4 and Requests to download the pages of webcomics, like xkcd, or order of the stick.

###Motivation in making this script:
This script was one of the practice projects in [Automate the Boring stuff with Python]. Writing this code helped develop my understanding of python, and the lesson from the chapter this project was in, specifically how to webscrape to grab files and information efficiently.

###Installation Instructions:

###How to use:
This program is very simple to use. Just follow the prompts inside of the command line prompt, and the webcomic you want downloaded should be put into a subfolder in the same folder the script is in.
